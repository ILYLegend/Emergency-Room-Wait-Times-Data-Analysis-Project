# Reducing Emergency Room Wait Times – Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the factors that contribute to **Emergency Room (ER) wait times** and proposes **data-driven solutions** to reduce them. Using a synthetic dataset inspired by real healthcare reports, I conducted a full analysis, created visual dashboards, and documented actionable insights to help improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – ER Wait Time Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rivalytics/er-wait-time)
- Description: Simulated ER visit data with variables including urgency levels, arrival times, staffing levels, patient outcomes, and more.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **JupyterLab**: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- **Tableau**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards

---

## Project Goals
- Identify the **key factors influencing ER wait times**
- Analyze **seasonal, daily, and time-of-day trends**
- Investigate the relationship between **wait time and patient satisfaction**
- Propose **operational recommendations** for improvement

---

## Key Findings
- **Higher urgency patients** are treated faster
- **Monday** and **evening** visits result in the longest wait times
- **Sundays** and **early mornings** have the shortest average wait times
- **Patient satisfaction drops** significantly as wait time increases
- Some **low-urgency patients leave** without being seen due to high wait times
- **Region and hospital location (rural/urban)** had little effect on wait times

---

## Recommendations
- Increase staffing during **peak times** (e.g., Mondays, evenings, winter)
- Launch **public education campaigns** on injury prevention
- Consider **automated triage tools** to better prioritize patients
